Koch Snowflake
--------------

The [Koch Snowflake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake) is one of the earliest fractal curves to have been described. It generates a snowflake fractal from equilateral triangles.

This project allows you to specify an arbitrary shape and see what the fractal pattern will be.

Technology

This was created during a hackathon by [Jason Hills](https://github.com/argonauthills) and [Sean Hess](https://github.com/seanhess)

It uses [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) with [Om](https://github.com/swannodette/om) which uses [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/) under the hood.
